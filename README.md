# SYNOPSIS
With the advent of technology, our young ones have also gotten involved in using various devices in the modern world. Not only was it a struggle for a parent to minimize their screen time but was also an effort to divert their attention to other productive things physically.

# MOTIVATION
Due to the rise of the pandemic, adults and especially children are required to stay indoors, adults began working remotely and people have nowhere to go to stroll outdoors safely. With this, children of ages 6-12 years began to be immersed in smartphones and gadgets with excessive screen time with little to no engagement in physical activities.
