#MOTIVATION
Due to the rise of the pandemic, adults and especially children are required to stay indoors, adults began working remotely and people have nowhere to go to stroll outdoors safely. With this, children of ages 6-12 years began to be immersed in smartphones and gadgets with excessive screen time with little to no engagement in physical activities.
